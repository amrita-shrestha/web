Enhancement: Run web as oc10 sidecar

Running web inside docker was supported as application mode, in some cases it is needed to run it as a 'sidecar' deployment.
This now is supported out of the box without any additional configuration.

Copy config/config.json.sample-oc10 to config/config.json, run dev server build and start oc10 from the docker-compose file and open http://localhost:9100.
